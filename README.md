## Structure

The site will consist of 1 main page which will have all the information provided on the main page such as the name of the game, the aim of the game, a score panel and a timer alongside with a reset button which will reset the current game being played by the user, and of course the card pannel containing 16 cards with 8 images including their respective pair. Once the user completes the game, they are provided with a well done message and a thumbs up image with feedback of the time taken to complete aswell as their score rating, it will also provide the user an option to play again with a play again button.

## Features

* A clear title of the game aswell as a clear instruction of what the aim of the game is

* A score pannel of how well they are doing during the progression of the game aswell as a move counter to show how many moves they are using

* A timer when the player begins the game so they are aware of how long it takes them to complete aswell as a reset button if the user feels they want to restart the game

* The game will include 16 cards with a pair for each 8 images included in the game for the player to match, if the player gets an incorrect match then the cards flip over, but if they get a correct match, an animation appears and the images stay visible making it easier for the players to match other pairs further on during the game

* The player will be presented a well done message once they complete the game with feedback of how they did interms of time and moves used which will generate a score, the player will also be given an option to play again through clicking a play again button

***

## Future Features

* A future feature that I would like to add is probably some sort of leaderboard with the best times taken to complete the game aswell as amount of moves taken, that way players will feel more motivated to play and carry on to compete for the top spot

* Another future feature that I would like to implement is different types of games to the site (not just a memory game) so that if the user feels they want a differnt game to play they have the option there, to keep them more engaged with the site

* Another future feature that would be a good feature is to apply a countdown timer when the user starts the game as this would apply the user a slight sense of pressure to complete the game before the countdown ends making them feel more engaged into the game

## Typography and color scheme

* The theme of the game was actually taken from a game I enjoy myself which is from call of duty and their zombies game mode so I thought of a way to implement the theme into the game through the use of relevant images of the game aswell as a specific color scheme

* The three main colours involved with my project are black, grey and red, as my game is based on a zombie themed game from call of duty which i am aware people are familiar with so I have added the color red to the cards but inside a grey box, with a light grey background and black text

* The fonts used were from google fonts with the font familys roboto and new tegomin as I feel the new tegomin font style fits very well for the zombie theme approach of the game and the roboto balances it out so that the games font and text in general doesnt look to takky at all

* All images used for the game was taken from google search as I needed the specific images related to the theme of the game

## Technology

### Languages & Frameworks

* HTML5 - Mark-up language used to create the pages for site using semantic structure
* CCS3 - Cascading style sheet used to style the site, aswell as adding media queries to make it responsive for pretty much all devices
* Javascript - Programming language used to create functions working for the site
* [Gitpod.io](https://www.gitpod.io/) - Used for creating the workspace for writing the code. Using the command line terminal for commiting and pushing to GIT Hub
* [GitHub](https://github.com/) - Used for hosting repositories
* GIT - Used for pushing the code to repositories

### Front End

* [Google fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) - Used for the Font
* [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) - For the icons used

### Planning

* [Balsamic Wireframes](https://balsamiq.com/) - Used to create the wireframe designs of the site
* [Iamresponsive](http://ami.responsivedesign.is/) - Used for mockup images

## Testing

### Supported screens:

With the use of CSS media queries styles, using the google chrome inspect tool, I was able to see that my site is supported for all screens with a width of 280px. I did some testing by sending my website link to my friends and familys devices and they had seen no issues.

### Supported browsers:

The website link has been tested on Google chrome, Internet Explorer and Microsoft edge, Brave and Firefox.

### OS compatibility:

Tested on iOS, Android 10, and Windows 10. - I asked a friend with an Adroid to test that it was working. Tested for responsiveness using Chrome DevTools.

### Peformance Testing:

Tested on the Developer Tools Lighthouse.

### Code validation:

* When completing my HTML code, I had then inputed the code through [w3schools validator](https://validator.w3.org/) and found that there was no errors in the code

* When completing my CSS code, I had then inputed the code through [w3schools validator](https://validator.w3.org/) and selected the CSS option and found that again just like the HTML code there was no errors in the code

* When completing my Javascript code, I had then inputed the code through the [Javascript validator (JS hint)](https://jshint.com/) to ensure there was no erros in the Javascript code, it turns out there was no errors in the code

### Test User Stories

### First time users

* #### I want to easily understand what type of game it is that I am playing and what the aim of the game is

The name of the game is presented at the top of the page along with clear instuction on how to start and play
![instructions](README-files/testinstructions.png)

* #### I want to be presented with a positive message once i complete the game alongside with the progress of how i did

Once the user matches all cards, they are presented with a well done message telling them they have found all 8 pairs of cards with a thumbs up image, they are also provided with the time taken to complete along with the moves taken to complete which then provides them with their star rating
![Well done message](README-files/testwelldonemsge.png)

### Visting Users

* #### I want to see how long it takes me to complete the game so that i can keep improving my speed and memory

A timer is presented on screen that starts counting up once the user clicks on a card
![timer](README-files/testtimer.png)

* #### I want to know what my score rating is so that i can aim to get the highest score rating possible

A score panel is presented above the timer for users to see how well they are doing aswell as the amount of moves used

![score panel](README-files/testscorepanel.png)

* #### I want to restart my current game if i am currently not happy with it

There is a reset button presented above the card panel for users to click allowing them to start fresh which will reset the cards positions, the timer and the score panel along with the amount of moves used
![reset button](README-files/testresetbtn.png)

### All Users

* #### I want a game that is fully functional alongside being responsive on any device

By using css media queries, the game is responsive and playable across all devices alongside with all buttons and functions working

![Responsive](README-files/testresponsive.png)

* #### I want to have the option to play again once i finish

Once the user finishes the game and is presented with the well done message, there is a play again button which will allow users to play again
![play again button](README-files/testplyagain.png)

### Fixed Bugs:

* A major bug I was experiencing when creating my project was that my game was not responsive for a lot of smaller screen devices such as the galaxy fold, so I then added some media queries to adjust the sizing issue of the card deck pannel for screens that had small widths

* Another bug I was experiencing was when viewing the page through the python3 -mhttp.server comand in the terminal, the site was not showing as this is because I realised I had called the html file game.html, which I then changed it to index.html so that it views properly
