# Milestone project 2: Building a memory game

## The purpose of the project

* To create an easy and responsive memory game using HTML, CSS and Javascript for users to engage and test themselves to see how good their memory is so that they can improve further by replaying again.

## User stories

### First time visitor goals:

* As a first time visitor, i want to easily understand what type of game it is that i am playing and what the aim of the game is with a clear instruction of the game present. I also want to know my progress of how i am doing in the game and when i complete it, i am presented with feed back of how i done in the game with an option to play the game again.

### Visting User goals:

* As a visiting user to the game, i want to keep practicsing the game and understand how long it takes for me to complete, aswell as how many attempts i need to end up completing the game that way i can test how good my memory is. By using the reset button i can keep practisicing to perfect the amount of moves required to get the highest score star rating.

## Features

* The memory game will include a clear title of the game aswell as a clear instruction of what the aim of the game is.

* The game will also include a score pannel of how well they are doing during the progression of the game aswell as a move counter to show how many moves they are using.

* The game will also include a timer when the player begins the game so they are aware of how long it takes them to complete aswell as rest button if the user feels they want to restart the game.

* The game will include 16 cards with a pair for each 8 images included in the game for the player to match, if the player gets an incorrect match then the cards flip over, but if they get a correct match, an animation appaears and the images stay visible making it easier for the players to match other pairs further on during the game.

* The player will be presented a congratulations message once they complete the game with feedback of how they did interms of time and moves used which will generate a score, the player will also be given an option to play again through clicking a play again button.

## Future Features

* A fututre feature that i would like to add is probably somesort of leaderboard with the best times taken to complete the game aswell as amount of moves taken, that way players will feel more motivated to play and carry on to compete with the top spot

* Another future feature that i would also like to implement is different types of games to the sight (not just a memory game) so that if the user feels they wnat a differnt game to play they have the option there to keep them even more engaged with the site

* Another future feature that would be a good feature is to apply a countdown timer when the user starts the game as this would apply the user a slight sense of pressure to complete the game before the countdown ends making them feel more engaged into the game

## Typography and color scheme

* The theme of the game was actually taken from a game i enjoy myself which is from call of duty and their zombies game mode so i thought of a way to implement the theme into the game through the use of relevant images of the game aswell as a specific color scheme.

* The three main colours involved with my project are black, grey and red, as my game is based on a zombie themed game from call of duty which im aware people are familiar with so i have added the color red to the cards but inside a grey box, with a light grey background and black text.

* The fonts used were from google fonts with the font familys roboto and new tegomin as i feel the new tegomin font style fits very well for the zombie theme approach of the game and the roboto balances it out so that the games font and text in general doesnt look to takky at all.

* All images used for the game was taken from google search as i needed the specific images related to the theme of the game.


## Wireframes

## Technology

* The Languages i have used to create this project are HTML to add the core content of the game, CSS to style the content of the game and Javascript to esnure the game runs and functions as intended to 

* I have also used google Fonts to get the specific font styles needed, fontawesome to use font awesome icons for the game 

* I have also used Balsamiq wireframes to create the wire frames for the game 

* I have also used Github to create the code of the game aswell as using github do deploy the github pages

## Testing

### Code validation:

* When completing my HTML code, I had then inputed the code through w3schools validator (https://validator.w3.org/) and found that there was no errors in the code

* When completing my CSS code, I had then inputed the code through w3schools validator (https://validator.w3.org/) and selected the CSS option and found that again just like the HTML code there was no errors in the code

* When completing my Javascript code, I had then inputed the code through the Javascript validator (https://jshint.com/) to ensure there was no erros in the Javascript code, it turns out there was no errors in the code

### Test Cases:

* In regards to test cases and seeing if the project meeters the user stories, here is a screenshot of the game and how it is presented when loaded up on screen (https://github.com/adilkhr/my-ms2-project/blob/master/testing/gamescreen.png)

* When the user gradually starts to match more cards it will end up being easier for them to complete the game and use less moves to match which this will affect their score/star rating, for visiting users the reset option is avaiable if they want to reset the game and start again if they feel that they have used to many moves which would have affected their score here is a screenshot of how it the game looks when in action (https://github.com/adilkhr/my-ms2-project/blob/master/testing/matchingcards.png)

* When the user completed the game they are then presented with a well done message to congratulate them for completing it with feed back of how they did interms of time taken and moves used which calculates their final score rating, here is a screenshot of how it looks (https://github.com/adilkhr/my-ms2-project/blob/master/testing/endgamemessage.png)

### Fixed Bugs:

* A major bug i was experiencing when creating my project was that i had found out that my game was not responsive for a lot of smaller screen devices such as the galaxy fold, so i then added some media queries to adjust the sizing issue of the card deck pannel for screens that had small widths

* Another bug i was experiencing was when viewing the page through the python3 -mhttp.server comand in the terminal, the site was not showing as this is because i realised i had called the html file game.html, which i then changed it to index.html so that it views properly

### Supported screens and browsers:

* When viewing the page through browser i used the google chrome inspect tool to see if the game is responsive for all screens, and with the use of media queries to adjust the size of the deck pannel and cards for different screens widths, the site is responsive for all screens and devices and supports browsers

## Deployment

The deployment process of my project was simple, when creating my html page through gitpod i had made sure that i had added the file and then git commit it with a message then done a git push, once that was done iensured that i had deployed the github pages by going on the github pages section and changed the source branch to master so that the site would be live and published giving me the live sight URL. I had ensured that git commit adds and git commit messages were done regurlaly and nessecary with relevant comments and then pushed out with the git push comand through git pod
