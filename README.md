# Milestone project 2: Building a memory game

## The purpose of the project

* To create an easy and responsive memory game using HTML, CSS and Javascript for users to engage and test themselves to see how good their memory is so that they can improve further by replaying again.

## User stories

### First time visitor goals:

* As a first time visitor, i want to easily understand what type of game it is that i am playing and what the aim of the game is with a clear instruction of the game present. I also want to know my progress of how i am doing in the game and when i complete it, i am presented with feed back of how i done in the game with an option to play again.

### Existing User goals:

* As an existing user to the game, i want to keep practicsing the game and understand how long it takes for me to complete, aswell as how many attempts i need to end up completing the game that way i can test how good my memory is.

## Features

* The memory game will include a clear title of the game aswell as a clear instruction of what the aim of the game is.

* The game will also include a score pannel of how well they are doing during the progression of the game aswell as a move counter to show how many moves they are using.

* The game will also include a timer when the player begins the game so they are aware of how long it takes them to complete aswell as rest button if the user feels they want to restart the game.

* The game will include 16 cards with a pair for each 8 images included in the game for the player to match, if the player gets an incorrect match then the cards flip over, but if they get a correct match, an animation appaears and the images stay visible making it easier for the players to match other pairs further on during the game.

* The player will be presented a congratulations message once they complete the game with feedback of how they did interms of time and moves used which will generate a score, the player will also be given an option to play again through clicking a play again button.

## Future Features

* A fututre feature that i would like to add is probably somesort of leaderboard with the best times taken to complete the game aswell as amount of moves taken, that way players will feel more motivated to play and carry on to compete with the top spot

* Another future feature that i would also like to implement is different types of games to the sight (not just a memory game) so that if the user feels they wnat a differnt game to play they have the option there to keep them even more engaged with the site

## Typography and color scheme

* The theme of the game was actually taken from a game i enjoy myself which is from call of duty and their zombies game mode so i thought of a way to implement the theme into the game through the use of relevant images of the game aswell as a specific color scheme.

* The three main colours involved with my project are black, grey and red, as my game is based on a zombie themed game from call of duty which im aware people are familiar with so i have added the color red to the cards but inside a grey box, with a light grey background and black text.

* The fonts used were from google fonts with the font familys roboto and new tegomin as i feel the new tegomin font style fits very well for the zombie theme approach of the game and the roboto balances it out so that the games font and text in general doesnt look to takky at all.

* All images used for the game was taken from google search as i needed the specific images related to the theme of the game.
