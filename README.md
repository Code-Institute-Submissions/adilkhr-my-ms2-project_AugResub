## The purpose of the project

* To create an easy and responsive memory game based on the game call of duty zombies using HTML, CSS and Javascript for users to engage and test themselves to see how good their memory is so that they can improve further by replaying again.

***

## User Experience (UX)

## Strategy

### User stories

#### First time visitor goals:

* A game that is fun to play

#### What a user may want:

* A timer to show how long it takes for them to complete the game

* Clear instructions of the game and what the aim of the game is

* A reset button to reset the game to start again if they are not happy with their current progress

## Structure

The site will consist of 1 main page which will have all the information provided on the main page such as the name of the game, the aim of the game, a score panel and a timer alongside with a reset button which will reset the current game being played by the user, and of course the card pannel containing 16 cards with 8 images including their respective pair. Once the user completes the game, they are provided with a well done message and a thumbs up image with feedback of the time taken to complete aswell as their score rating, it will also provide the user an option to play again with a play again button.

## Features

* A clear title of the game aswell as a clear instruction of what the aim of the game is.

* A score pannel of how well they are doing during the progression of the game aswell as a move counter to show how many moves they are using.

* A timer when the player begins the game so they are aware of how long it takes them to complete aswell as reset button if the user feels they want to restart the game.

* The game will include 16 cards with a pair for each 8 images included in the game for the player to match, if the player gets an incorrect match then the cards flip over, but if they get a correct match, an animation appears and the images stay visible making it easier for the players to match other pairs further on during the game.

* The player will be presented a well done message once they complete the game with feedback of how they did interms of time and moves used which will generate a score, the player will also be given an option to play again through clicking a play again button.

***

## Future Features

* A fututre feature that I would like to add is probably somesort of leaderboard with the best times taken to complete the game aswell as amount of moves taken, that way players will feel more motivated to play and carry on to compete for the top spot

* Another future feature that I would like to implement is different types of games to the site (not just a memory game) so that if the user feels they want a differnt game to play they have the option there, to keep them more engaged with the site

* Another future feature that would be a good feature is to apply a countdown timer when the user starts the game as this would apply the user a slight sense of pressure to complete the game before the countdown ends making them feel more engaged into the game

## Typography and color scheme

* The theme of the game was actually taken from a game I enjoy myself which is from call of duty and their zombies game mode so I thought of a way to implement the theme into the game through the use of relevant images of the game aswell as a specific color scheme.

* The three main colours involved with my project are black, grey and red, as my game is based on a zombie themed game from call of duty which im aware people are familiar with so I have added the color red to the cards but inside a grey box, with a light grey background and black text.

* The fonts used were from google fonts with the font familys roboto and new tegomin as I feel the new tegomin font style fits very well for the zombie theme approach of the game and the roboto balances it out so that the games font and text in general doesnt look to takky at all.

* All images used for the game was taken from google search as I needed the specific images related to the theme of the game.

***

## Technology

* The Languages I have used to create this project are HTML to add the core content of the game, CSS to style the content of the game and Javascript to esnure the game runs and functions as intended to 

* I have also used google Fonts to get the specific font styles needed, fontawesome to use font awesome icons for the game 

* I have also used Balsamiq wireframes to create the wire frames for the game 

* I have also used Github to create the code of the game aswell as using github do deploy the github pages

## Testing

### Supported screens:

With the use of CSS media queries styles, using the google chrome inspect tool, I was able to see that my site is supported for all screens with a width of 280px. I did some testing by sending my website link to my friends and familys devices and they had seen no issues.

### Supported browsers:

The website link has been tested on Google chrome, Internet Explorer and Microsoft edge, Brave and Firefox.

### OS compatibility:

Tested on iOS, Android 10, and Windows 10. - I asked a friend with an Adroid to test that it was working. Tested for responsiveness using Chrome DevTools.

### Peformance Testing:

Tested on the Developer Tools Lighthouse.

### Code validation:

* When completing my HTML code, I had then inputed the code through w3schools validator (https://validator.w3.org/) and found that there was no errors in the code

* When completing my CSS code, I had then inputed the code through w3schools validator (https://validator.w3.org/) and selected the CSS option and found that again just like the HTML code there was no errors in the code

* When completing my Javascript code, I had then inputed the code through the Javascript validator (https://jshint.com/) to ensure there was no erros in the Javascript code, it turns out there was no errors in the code

### Test User Stories:

* In regards to test cases and seeing if the project meeters the user stories, here is a screenshot of the game and how it is presented when loaded up on screen

* When the user gradually starts to match more cards it will end up being easier for them to complete the game and use less moves to match which this will affect their score/star rating, for visiting users the reset option is avaiable if they want to reset the game and start again if they feel that they have used to many moves which would have affected their score here is a screenshot of how it the game looks when in action 

* When the user completed the game they are then presented with a well done message to congratulate them for completing it with feed back of how they did interms of time taken and moves used which calculates their final score rating, here is a screenshot of how it looks

### Fixed Bugs:

* A major bug I was experiencing when creating my project was that I had found out that my game was not responsive for a lot of smaller screen devices such as the galaxy fold, so I then added some media queries to adjust the sizing issue of the card deck pannel for screens that had small widths

* Another bug I was experiencing was when viewing the page through the python3 -mhttp.server comand in the terminal, the site was not showing as this is because I realised I had called the html file game.html, which I then changed it to index.html so that it views properly
