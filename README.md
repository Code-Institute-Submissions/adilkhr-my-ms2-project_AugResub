# Milestone project 1: Building a memory game

## The purpose of the project

* To create an easy and responsive memory game using HTML, CSS and Javascript for users to engage and test themselves to see how good their memory is so that they can improve further by replaying again.

## User stories

### First time visitor goals:

* As a first time visitor, i want to easily understand what type of game it is that i am playing and what the aim of the game is with a clear instruction of the game present. I also want to know my progress of how i am doing in the game and when i complete it, i am presented with feed back of how i done in the game with an option to play again.

### Existing User goals

* As an existing user to the game, i want to keep practicsing the game and understand how long it takes for me to complete, aswell as how many attempts i need to end up completing the game that way i can test how good my memory is.
